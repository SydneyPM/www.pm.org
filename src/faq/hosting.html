<h3>
  Why don't you offer service X?
</h3>
<p>
  Probably for security or cost reasons.
</p>
<h3>
  Didn't you previously offer basic web hosting?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, we did.  We stopped offering it to new groups in 2014.  It was
  a lot of upkeep for a relatively low benefit.  While it made sense
  for us to offer this service in 1999, fifteen years later there are
  lots of good, free hosting options.  Many groups
  use <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>
  or <a href="https://sites.google.com">Google Sites</a>.  Others host
  sites on the Google or Amazon clouds.
</p>

<p>
  As interest in Perl and Perl Mongers has declined, and the
  cost of supporting services has increased, we've scaled back what we
  provide.

<h3>
  Who do I contact for help?
</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/issues/new">Open an Issue</a>.
  Or send an email to support(at)pm(dot)org
</p>

  .pm.org DNS
</h2>
<p>
  We no longer provide A or CNAME records.  We will happily provide
  you with a HTTP 301 redirect to your website.
</p>
<h3>
  Will you delegate NS for my group?
</h3>
<p>
  No, sorry. Recent security exploits have convinced us not to delegate DNS
  offsite.
</p>
<h3>
  Will you point MX records to my SMTP server?
</h3>
<p>
  Nope.

  Group Mailing Lists (Mailman)
</h2>
<p>
  If you like, we'll host a Mailman mailing list for your group. You'll
  administer your list via the web interface (<a href=
                                                 "http://www.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/groupname">http://www.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/groupname</a>)
  and/or by emailing commands to the Mailman server.
</p>
<p>
  Also, as a group leader, you'll be added to a mailing list of your fellow
  administrators from around the world. It's a low-volume
  announcement-centric list.

  Email Forwarding
</h2>
<h3>
  Can you forward email sent to</a> groupname@pm.org (e.g.: omaha@pm.org)?
</h3>
<p>
  No.  We do not provide email forwarding services.
</p>
<h3>
  Can you forward email sent to username@pm.org (e.g.: jay_hannah@pm.org)?
</h3>
<p>
  No, we don't do this. It's proven to be too much maintenance. Sorry.
</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#new">*</a><a name="new"></a>
  How do I request a new group or to reactivate a group that has been inactive?
</h2>
<p>
  99% of the time your group name will be the name of the city in which your
  meetings will typically be held. So, since I live in Omaha my group name is
  Omaha.pm.
</p>
<p>
  We will not create new groups with short names, please do not ask.
  Some groups (i.e. New York as ny.pm) are grandfathered in.  Names
  should be descriptive and mean something to non-residents.  For
  example: MinneapolisStPaul.pm is best.  TwinCities.pm would be ok
  too (as that's a common and well known nickname for the area.)  If
  the nickname is not well known, expect pushback.  MSP.pm would be
  rejected.
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
  Fork our <a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/blob/master/perl_mongers.xml">github repository XML file</a>,
  and add your group's information. There are lots of examples in there for you to follow.
  Submit a github pull request with those changes and the answers to the these two questions:
</p>
<h4>
  (1) Where are you going to host your site's website?
</h4>
<p>
  Please provide the following:
</p>
<p>
  <ul class="faq">
    <li class="faq">URL to redirect yourgroup.pm.org to.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>
  (2) Do you want us to host a Mailman mailing list for you?
</h4>
<p>
  Indicate yes or no.
</p>

  github.com? What's that? And/or "github.com? boo!"
</h2>
<p>
  If you're not up to speed on github, or hate it, feel free to email all the information we'll need to support(at)pm(dot)org, and we'll do the github bits for you. Please be patient -- this option is more work for our volunteer admins, so it will likely take longer for them to respond to your request.
</p>

  <a href="#social">*</a><a name="social"></a>
  How do I add social networking buttons to my group listing on pm.org?

<p>
  Fork our <a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/blob/master/perl_mongers.xml">github repository XML file</a>,
  and add your group's information. See Israel.pm for examples. Send us a pull request.

  Who pays for Perl Mongers services?
</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.perl.org/siteinfo.html#sponsors">Our sponsors</a> do!

<h3>
  Can I help?
</h3>
<p>
  Sure!
</p>
<p>
  Send us hard drives and stuff
  on <a href="http://www.perl.org/wishlist.html">our wishlist</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Buy things from our sponsors!
</p>
<p>
  And put the following ad rotation HTML on your group website:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;script language="JavaScript" src="http://www.perl.org/misc/site-sponsor-js.html"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The output width is fixed at 180, but the height is variable. If you want
  to personalize the text message, you can add '?notext=1' to the src string.
  You can see the ad rotation in action at the bottom right corner of this page.
