[% WRAPPER layout title = "Perl Mongers: Administering pm.org Services" %]

<p>Welcome! This page intends to house all the information admins need to maintain pm.org services. Suggested improvements welcome via <a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/">GitHub</a></p>

<h1>Intro: How does *.pm.org work?</h1>

<p>Robert and Ask are the server kings. They control all the hardware and services. They keep the ships afloat.</p>

<p>When anyone needs help with anything Perl Mongers they <a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/issues">create a github Issue</a> or they email support(at)pm(dot)org which opens a ticket in RT. Some requests are valid, some are bad ideas or conflicts between group leaders, and some are spam. Those tickets need to be waded through, as frequently as possible, by the pm.org admin volunteers. Everything there is to know about being a pm.org admin volunteer is right here, below.</p>

<p>Working the tickets involves pulling miscellaneous levers to fulfill the valid requests (XML, git, MailMan, DNS, RT, TT site flushes, lat/long XML for Google map, etc.). I (jhannah) am happy to train new volunteers.</p>

<p>Every communication we have with anyone around the world is recorded in github or RT for review. Constructive criticism is always welcome.</p>

<h1>Procedures</h1>

<h2>Add a Group</h2>

<ol class="admin_faq">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/blob/master/perl_mongers.xml">perl_mongers.xml</a>
    <ol class="admin_faq">
      <li>Search to make sure the group didn't exist in a previous life.
        <ol class="admin_faq">
          <li>If you find the group, change their status to "active" and update all the info.</li>
          <li>If you don't find the group, add a new XML block, copying an existing active group and changing all the info.</li>
          <li>git: commit and push your changes</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>DNS for their website
    <ol class="admin_faq">
      <li>Create an RT ticket in the DNS queue requesting <em>Groupname</em>.pm.org be

          <pre>
          To: dns@perl.org
          Subject: paderborn.pm.org -> 216.52.237.133
          New PM group. Thanks!
          </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Mailman. If they want a Mailman list (and one doesn't exist already), create one named "<em>Groupname</em>-pm".</li>
</ol>

<p>Cron jobs run every 20 minutes or so to implement any new groups you add.</p>

<h2><a name="rt" id="rt">Request Tracker (RT)</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/">http://rt.perl.org/rt3/</a> (queue: pm-org-support)</p>

<p>Group leaders open a new support ticket by sending an email to any of these equivalent addresses:</p>

<ul class="admin_faq">
  <li>support(at)pm(dot)org</li>
  <li>tech(at)pm(dot)org</li>
  <li>bugs-pm-org-support(at)rt(dot)perl(dot)org</li>
</ul>

<h2>DNS</h2>

<p>In order to get a DNS change to happen, send an email to <code>dns(at)perl(dot)org</code> with information about the change you want made. You'll get an auto-reply ticket number back from RT. Things they do:</p>

<ul class="admin_faq">
  <li>A records - we will point them at groups.pm.org (216.52.237.133) or their server.</li>
  <li>CNAME records - sometimes this is easier than an A record</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample Message<pre>

 To:        dns@perl.org
 Subject:   aberdeen.pm.org -> 216.52.237.133
 
 New Perl Monger group. Thanks!
 </pre></p>

<h2><a name="xml" id="xml">XML</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/blob/master/perl_mongers.xml">https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/blob/master/perl_mongers.xml</a></p>

<p>
  All pm.org services are (or should be) driven by our single, master XML file.
  That file is <code>perl_mongers.xml</code>.
  The format is defined by <code>perl_mongers.dtd</code> (out of date).
  See /README for flushing our XML to our live site.

<h4>The "status" attribute</h4>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does a status mlb or leb mean?</p>

<p><strong>A: Dave Cross, November 2004:</strong> These are left over from when I was tracking down all of the groups in 2002. I emailed all of the group leaders to check if the group still existed. "leb" stands for "leaders email bouncing". In some cases I then went on to try and email the group's mailing list. "mlb" stands for "mailing list bouncing". I should probably change all of those statuses to "inactive" now.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a difference between inactive and sleeping?</p>

<p><strong>A: Dave Cross, November 2004:</strong> Inactive means that the group is basically dead. There's no interest in keeping the group going. I keep the records around because someone might come along in the future.</p>

<p>Sleeping means that there are one or two people who want to keep the group running, but they are having trouble finding recruits. The main difference is that the xml program generates listing pages for groups with a status of "active" or "sleeping" - but not for "inactive".</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> If status is not present, does that mean inactive?</p>

<p><strong>A: Dave Cross, November 2004:</strong> Yep.</p>
